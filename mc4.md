# Mini Challenge 4
## Knowledge base
### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create urlpatterns to support the "knowledge base" feature for the issue manager.
2. All views within the posts app should be accessible through the front end.
2.1. Consider adding a link to the navbar to the "knowledge base" where users can view the "published" posts.
2.2. Consider adding a link somewhere else that allows users to view "archived" posts.
2.3. Consider adding a link somewhere else that allows users to view their "draft" posts.
3. Test (make sure all views are available through the front-end).
## Note
Implement all missing urlpatterns, templates *and* configurations (as needed) to make the views in `posts` work.
